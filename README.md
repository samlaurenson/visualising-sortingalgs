# Visualising Sorting Algorithms
part 2 in the thrilling algorithms series

## https://samlaurenson.github.io/visualising-sortingalgs/ <- GitHub Page to give it a go :)

created this project because visualised sorting algorithms are theraputic
also because learning how to use react somewhat properly could be a bonus

only added in merge sort right now but might add a couple more later on

i have never really touched css before so don't berate me too much :)
